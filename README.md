# Mars Rover Kata

This repository is the code I wrote in TypeScript for he Mars Rover Kata, I took a TDD development approach.

## Introduction
The Kata asks you to create a program to move rovers around the surface of Mars!
The program has to implement the rules for the Mars Rover found below.

The surface of Mars is represented by a Plateau.
Rovers navigate the Plateau so they can use their special cameras üì∑ and robot arms
ü¶æ to collect samples back to Planet Earth üåè

### Assumptions 
 For the purpose of this task the assumption has been made that the Plateau is a square/rectangular grid,

## How the Mars Rover Works
This section contains definitions for the Rover and Plateau, and the input/output
expected.

### Representation of a Rover‚Äôs Position on the Plateau
The Plateau is divided into a grid. A Rover‚Äôs position is represented by x and y
co-ordinates and the letters N, S, W, E to represent North, South, West, East (the four
cardinal compass points) respectively.

#### Example
0 0 N
This means the Rover is at the bottom-left corner facing in the North direction.
N.B. Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1), and the square directly
East from (x, y) is (x + 1, y)

### Instructing a Rover to Move Around the Plateau
üíª To move a Rover around the Plateau, a string of letters is sent to a Rover.
Here are the letters and their resultant action:

#### Letter Action

L Spins the Rover 90 degrees Left without
moving from the current coordinate point

R Spins the Rover 90 degrees Right
without moving from the current
coordinate point

M Moves the Rover forward by one grid
point, maintaining the same
heading/orientation

N.B. Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).

### ‚å®Ô∏è Inputs into the Program

##### First Line of Input to the Program
The first line inputted into the program represents the upper-right coordinates of the
Plateau.
5 5
This Plateau has maximum (x, y) co-ordinates of (5, 5).
N.B. Assume that the lower-left coordinate is (0, 0).

##### Subsequent Lines of Input into the Program - Input to Rovers
This represents the instructions to move the rovers.
Each rover receives two lines of input.

##### First Line of Input to a Rover
The Rover‚Äôs position is represented by two integers representing the X and Y
coordinates and a letter representing where the Rover is facing (its orientation).
1 2 N

#### Second Line of Input to a Rover
A string of letters representing the instructions to move the Rover around the Plateau.

### üìè Movement Rules
Rovers move sequentially, this means that the first Rover needs to finish moving first
before the next one can move.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Output
For each Rover, the output represents its final position (final coordinates and where it is
facing).
